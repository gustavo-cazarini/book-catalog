Welcome to my personal project! This repository aims to enhance my skills in API development with .NET and front-end communication with React.js.

## Objective
The main goal of this project is to update and strengthen my understanding and skills in API development using the .NET platform, as well as effective integration with the front-end, especially using React.js.

## About the Project
This project will serve as an experimental platform where I can explore and apply the latest concepts and best practices in API development using .NET. Additionally, I will be enhancing my ability to create dynamic and responsive user interfaces with React.js, ensuring efficient communication between the back-end and front-end.
